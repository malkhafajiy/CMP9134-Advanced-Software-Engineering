### COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CMS)
#### Problem Definition: 
A course management system (CMS) is a collection of software tools providing an online environment for course interactions. A CMS typically includes a variety of online tools and environments, such as:
- An area for faculty posting of class materials such as course syllabus and handouts
- An area for student posting of papers and other assignments
- A grade book where faculty can record grades and each student can view his or her grades
- An integrated email tool allowing participants to send announcement email messages to the entire class or to a subset of the entire class
- A chat tool allowing synchronous communication among class participants
- A threaded discussion board allowing asynchronous communication among participants

In addition, a CMS is typically integrated with other databases in the university so that students enrolled in a particular course are automatically registered in the CMS as participants in that course. The Course Management System (CMS) is a web application for department personnel, academic senate, and registrar staff to view, enter, and manage course information formerly submitted via paper. Departments can use CMS to create new course proposals, submit changes for existing courses, and track the progress of proposals as they move through the stages of online approval. 

- Construct the design element for a course management system that can be used to manage courses and classes for an organisation that specialize in providing training.
- The organisation offers a variety of courses in a variety of areas such as computer science courses and engineering courses (electrical, civil, etc.).
- Each course is made up of set of modules.
- Lecturers are assigned courses to teach according to the area that is specialized in and their availability.
- The organisation publish and maintain a calendar of different courses and assign tutors every year.
- There is a group of Course administrator to manage the courses including course content, assign courses to tutor and define the course schedule.

## Procedure to follow

### Functional Requirements
## Step 1: Purpose and Scope
#### Purpose
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.Describe the different types of user that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.

#### Project Scope
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here. An SRS that specifies the next release of an evolving product should contain its own scope statement as a subset of the long-term strategic product vision.

## Step 2: System Description
#### Product Perspective
Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
 
#### Product Features
Summarize the major features the product contains or the significant functions that it performs or lets the user perform. Only a high level summary is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or a class diagram, is often effective.

#### User Classes and Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those who are less important to satisfy.

#### Operating Environment
Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.

#### Design and Implementation Constraints
Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).

## Step 3: Features
#### System Features
This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.

1-	Description and Priority
Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).
 
2-	Stimulus/Response Sequences
List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.

3-	Functional Requirements
Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary.

*Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.
REQ-1:
REQ-2:
etc..
 

## Step 4: Interface Requirements
#### User Interfaces
Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

#### Hardware Interfaces
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### Software Interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.
 
#### Communications Interfaces
Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.


------------
### Nonfunctional Requirements
#### Performance Requirements
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

#### Safety Requirements
Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the productâ€™s design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be satisfied.

#### Security Requirements
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

#### Software Quality Attributes
Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.

#### Other Requirements
Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.
