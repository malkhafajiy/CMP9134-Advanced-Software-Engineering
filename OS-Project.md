# Contribute to Open Source Projects
Most developers and companies depend on open-source tools and software to make their products/services. 

## What is Open Source?
In simple words, we can describe an open source project as source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.
Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.

### Why Contribute to Open Source?
- It will help sharpen your skills of coding and improvement into writing clean code.
- It helps the community and your peers get to know you. This recognition can bring you a lot of opportunities in your career.
- It helps you learn more about project management, and it could leave you inspired to start your own project.


## Open Source Projects
Contributing works on all levels, there is no need to over think how you're gonna do it. Instead think of some of the projects you already use and how you can make a change to them or improve on them. Here are some possible projects that you can work on for Assignment 2.

## How to contribute to an open-source project?
There are numerous open-source projects avalible online - but how do you get started? Here’s a quick summary of Open Source Guide on How to Contribute to Open Source:

### 1. Where to find open-source projects to contribute to?
You might wonder where to even start when deciding to take a chance and contribute to an open-source project. 
You might want to explore these websites:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)
- [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)
- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)
- [Python project scripts](https://github.com/larymak/Python-project-Scripts)

There, you will likely find many open-source projects and detailed instructions on how to contribute to them.

### 2. How to spot a good project to contribute to?
There are a couple of ways to determine if the project you want to contribute to is worth your time. 

First of all, see if it has a license in the root of the repository to eliminate the chances of the project not being open source.

After that, check how active the project is. Are the latest commit and pull requests recent? Is there multiple contributors? Are the opened issues and pull requests responded to quickly? Are issues getting closed?

If you determine that the project is active, it’s probably a good one to contribute to!

### 3. How to actually contribute to an open source project?
First of all, look for contributing docs in the repository to determine what sort of contribution is accepted and what the process looks like. You won’t find this file in every project though.

Secondly, you don’t have to necessarily contribute code! You can help with design, help to improve the project’s documentation, organize duplicate issues, and more.

Of course, most of the open-source contributors contribute code. Here’s how you can do it:
- Open an issue if you need to report an error, propose a new feature, or discuss a high-level topic. Communicate directly and give context to your proposal.
- Open a pull request if you want to submit easy fixes (smaller error), or start working on a contribution that was already discussed in an open issue.
